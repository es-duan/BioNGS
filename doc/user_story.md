# User story template:
## NAME, OCCUPATION
- What do they want to do with the tool
- What needs and desires do they want
- What is their skill level

# User story 1:
## A, undergrad
- A is working on a Mary Gates undergrad research project. They are primarily doing wet lab work and want to process their sequencing data using this analysis pipeline.
- They have received their NGS fastq file and want to use this file to calculate mutation rates.
- They have primarily used spreadsheets to process data and have no experience programming.

# User story 2:
## B, postdoc
- B is submitting a grant to assess base-level mutation rate to rifampicin for a wide range of bacterial species. They do both wet lab and computational work and want to process their sequencing data using this pipeline.
- They have received their NGS fastq files. They have prepared reference genomes for alignment across their species.
- They are very experienced in python, R, and CLI.

# User story 3:
## C, grad student
- C is a grad student that is starting a new research project. They are interested in using this method to estimate mutation rate in a new strain and gene. They have not run any experiments yet.
- They want to run the pipeline with example data to determine how to write their protocol for their strains.
- They have some experience in R, but are unfamiliar with python and CLI.

# User Story #4 
## B, Graduate Student
-This student, Rafaela, wants to create an image representing her population's mutation rate to present in her lab meeting at the end of the week
- She needs this tool to be able to catch mistakes in the fastq file so she doesn't present false data, bt she needs it to work swiftly and seamlessly 
- she has a basic familarity with coding in python, but not thorough with all

#User Story #5
## C, Research Scientist (Gilbert Grape)
- Staff scientist also wanting to process their fastq file for understanding mutation rates of their bacteria populations
- Gilbert wants to understand how the tool works under the hood so they can verify it is processing the data correctly
- Gilbert needs to be able to track what is done with code coherently to understand how it is processing the data
- Gilbert has years of python experience

I want to cause problems with a MERGE CONFLICT
