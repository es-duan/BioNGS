# User story template:
## NAME, OCCUPATION
- What do they want to do with the tool
- What needs and desires do they want
- What is their skill level

# User story 1:
## A, undergrad
- A is working on a Mary Gates undergrad research project. They are primarily doing wet lab work and want to process their sequencing data using this analysis pipeline.
- They have received their NGS fastq file and want to use this file to calculate mutation rates.
- They have primarily used spreadsheets to process data and have no experience programming.

# User story 2:
## B, postdoc
- B is submitting a grant to assess base-level mutation rate to rifampicin for a wide range of bacterial species. They do both wet lab and computational work and want to process their sequencing data using this pipeline.
- They have received their NGS fastq files. They have prepared reference genomes for alignment across their species.
- They are very experienced in python, R, and CLI.

# User story 3:
## C, grad student
- C is a grad student that is starting a new research project. They are interested in using this method to estimate mutation rate in a new strain and gene. They have not run any experiments yet.
- They want to run the pipeline with example data to determine how to write their protocol for their strains.
- They have some experience in R, but are unfamiliar with python and CLI.
