# Use case 1: calculate base level mutation rate
- User wants the mutation rates calculated at the end of the pipeline.

# Use case 2: check the quality of NGS data inputted
- User wants to check how many reads successfully mapped to an index pair specified by the metadata csv. If too many reads do not map, this could specify experimental error during PCR processing.

# Use case 3: check the success of UMI protocol
- User wants to check how many UMIs were outputted from each population, and how many reads have the same UMI. This gives guidance on PCR efficiency and sequencing resolution.
